### Term: Spring 2016
### Professor: David Meyer, Tim Rogers
### Software used: Free scale CodeWarrior IDE
### Microcontroller used: HCS12-9S12
### Language used: Assembly, C

Welcome to my repository for ECE 362, where we learn how to work with a microcontroller taken at Purdue University. This course is amazing as we learn about how to write instructions on low level and see how actually our computers process data from basic to complex arithmetic. We used Assembly for first half to understand how instructions are parsed, while later half is in C.

This course also holds another exciting facet, which is project design where we can make anything using the above mentioned Microcontroller with any perpheral devices such as breakout boards, sensors, etc.

This repository consists of following:
* Code regarding to the class
* Practice codes, whose refrence are taken from this book: [HCS12-9S12 book](http://www.amazon.com/The-HCS12-9S12-Introduction-Interfacing/dp/1435427424)

>##### Note: For future ECE 362 students, please use my work as only refrence and not a substitute for your lab work, as it will only hurt your learning process.
